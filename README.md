# IIT-Event-Management-App
IIT Users can create new events and host them with a number of modifications, see users RSVPed, email everyone etc. 
Non-IIT users can sign up on our server (currently offline) & participate in interested events, customize app to change colors, background, categories they are interested in, etc.
Real time events or events in future is shown on a map by color coded pins with different color for ongoing & future events respectively. Notifications are received specific to events, based on changes in event details etc. Everything is dynamic. Admin can send out a message (regular one or a customizable alert e.g. higher priority one) through Admin panel. He/she can manage all messages and also delete sent ones. When admin sends a message, it is displayed to all users in their apps under Messages and Alerts, thus maintaining safety too. Other features include sharing event via whatsapp, email etc., report any issues to the dev team, save events of their choice to calendar and many more. 
This app is a great way for members of the IIT community to learn about and view all activities planned at IIT, owing to the fact that IIT alone has over 200+ student organizations.
